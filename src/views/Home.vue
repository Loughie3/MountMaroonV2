            Our farmhouse is the perfect retreat for that getaway, all within
            less than a 90-minute drive from Brisbane/Gold Coast. Only 15
            minutes from Boonah and 3 minutes from Maroon Dam, this picturesque
            farm is ideal for a Scenic Rim getaway, writers retreat, artist
            inspiration, or wedding accommodation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The farmhouse is perched on the highest point of the property,
            commanding 180Â° views of the valley and mountains. Enjoy the
            changing colours of Mt Maroon from two decks and wander across five
            paddocks.

            There are 24 Sheep and two cheeky horses that love to get a carrot
            or apple. They may even go for a walk with you in the main paddock.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Our house is very spacious for a couple with three decks and out
            door undercover areas to enjoy the views. There are fold out tables

            is a HD TV and an open Netflicks account ,but no WiFi or Free to Air

            kitchen is set up for self-catering and has a microwave, oven,
            kettle and toaster with pantry staples and a well stocked spice

            The nearest supermarket is in Boonah, (Drakes IGA) call into Oppy's
            fruit and Veg for local fresh produce. We can recommend the two
            quality butchers in town for supplies. Fire pit outside (weather
            permitting) and being in a rural area, fire restrictions are
            sometimes in place . There is extra wood for sale at the Farm. There
            is an office work space complete with extra monitor (if you need to
            work )
